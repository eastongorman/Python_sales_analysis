# Python_sales_analysis
Sales analysis of Instacart using Python
# Objective
The project focused on Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales but wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the criteria they provided.
# Data
The data consisted of the following information:
- Orders
- Customers
- Products
- Departments
